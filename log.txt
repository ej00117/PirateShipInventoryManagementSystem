    Implemented change log saving when a new stock is added to the system
    
    View stock changes page is now visible and presents a list of logs from any items added while interacting with the system. View and ViewModel implemented to support just the basic action of listing change logs for now.

    Implemented view and Model for adding stock page and for the page to list the compartments available to add stock to
    
    Now, when the add stock button on the landing page is selected, the user will be prompted to enter details for adding a new stock. The user will not be able to add the stock unless the details are filled out correctly. If there is available space in a compartment for the stock the user wants to add, a new window will pop up with a list of compartments that they may add the stock to. A few model classes were altered as necessary to accomplish this task, with new test cases being written accordingly.

    Implemented new FXML, ViewModel, and View for the landing page
    
    Updated LoginCodeBehind to pop up the new landing page window once a user makes a successful login attempt. The landing page says hello to the user that logged in and shows them their roles. The add stock and view changes buttons are enabled and disabled automatically depending on the roles of the user that logged into the system.

    Updated View, Code Behind, and FXML file to support the login page functionality
    
    Updated FXML file, view model, and view to handle the responsibilities necessary for submitting user credentials to log into the system. Deleted the old example files from the starter project as well. On the login page, the submit button is disabled unless a valid, non-blank, username and password combination are entered. Currently, the system pops up an alert if the login was unsuccessfully due to the credentials not being present in the system.

    Implemented and Tested ChangeLog and History classes, and updated compartment and inventory for logging
    
    Implemented and tested ChangeLog class, which models a change log with details that support the use case scenario. Implemented and tested ChangeHistory, a class that holds a list of ChangeLog items, detailing a history a changes. Updated compartment to include a name field and updated inventory to ensure that compartments in the list have unique names.

    Implemented and Tested Compartment and Inventory classes
    
    Implemented and Tested two new classes that define the storage compartments for different types of special quality stock items. The compartment itself holds a specific capacity of items of a specific type or combination of types. The inventory class holds the list of these compartments and manages all of them. Also refactored the name of an unrelated test case that I mispelt earlier.

    Implemented and Tested Stock and PerishableStock classes
    
    Added two new classes and tested them rigorously. Stock class models a regular, non-perishable, stock and thus does not have an expiration date. PerishableStock extends Stock and adds functionality to track the expiration date of the stock. Created two new enums, Condition and SpecialQuality to help with defining the attributes, namely the condition and special qualities of a Stock or PerishableStock item..

    Implemented and Tested User and Authenticator Model Classes
    
    Implemented and Tested two new model classes to provide business logic for logging into the system. User class models a user, with a name, password, and an arraylist of roles, from a newly created Role enum. The authenticator class stores the list of users in the system, with two example users being initialized in the constructor. Authenticator has two methods, one for authenticating a user's provided credentials and another to be used for getting the roles from a user stored in the list.
